All pipelines take you from raw data received from your sequencing facility to finished analysis using Beocat https://www.cis.ksu.edu/beocat (the largest compute cluster in Kansas which is free to all researchers in the K-INBRE network).\r\n\r\nNo experience with command line is necessary before using these scripts but a free Beocat account is. \r\n\r\nAll of the scripts you will need to complete use these pipelines as well as the sample dataset will be copied to your Beocat directory as you follow the instructions in the links below. You should type or paste the text in the beige code block into your terminal as you follow along with the instructions. If you are not used to commandline, practice with real data is one of the best ways to learn.\r\n\r\nIf you would like a quick primer on basic linux commands try these 10 minute lessons from Software Carpentry http://software-carpentry.org/v4/shell/index.html. For Beocat basics see http://support.cis.ksu.edu/BeocatDocs/GettingStarted.\r\n\r\n### Genome assembly\r\n********************\r\n\r\n### Go to: \r\nhttps://github.com/i5K-KINBRE-script-share/transcriptome-and-genome-assembly/blob/master/KSU_bioinfo_lab/AssembleG/AssembleG_LAB.md\r\n\r\nThe script \"AssembleG.pl\" to organizes your working directory and writes scripts to clean your reads, assembles your data or the de novo genome for Staphylococcus aureus from the sample data, and summarize your assembly metrics.\r\n\r\nTo begin this lab your should read about the software we will be using. Prinseq will be used to clean raw reads. Priseq cleaning is highly customizable. You can see a detailed parameter list by typing `perl /homes/sheltonj/abjc/prinseq-lite-0.20.3/prinseq-lite.pl -h` or by visiting their manual at http://prinseq.sourceforge.net/manual.html. You can read a detailed list of parameter options for Abyss genome assembler by typing `/homes/bjsco/local/bin/abyss-pe -h` or visit the Abyss manual at https://github.com/bcgsc/abyss#abyss.\r\n\r\nTo find out more about the parameters for \"AssembleG.pl\" run `perl ~/transcriptome-and-genome-assembly/KSU_bioinfo_lab/AssembleG/AssembleG.pl -man` or visit its manual at https://github.com/i5K-KINBRE-script-share/transcriptome-and-genome-assembly/tree/master/KSU_bioinfo_lab/AssembleG/AssembleG_README.md.\r\n\r\n### Transcriptome assembly\r\n************************\r\n\r\n### Go to: \r\nhttps://github.com/i5K-KINBRE-script-share/transcriptome-and-genome-assembly/blob/master/KSU_bioinfo_lab/AssembleT/AssembleT_LAB.md\r\n\r\nThe script \"AssembleT.pl\" organizes your working directory and writes scripts to clean your reads, assemble your de novo transcriptome for your data or the human breast cancer cell lines from the sample data, and summarize your assembly metrics.\r\n\r\nTo you should read about the software we will be using. Prinseq will be used to clean raw reads. Priseq cleaning is highly customizable.

You can read a detailed list of parameter options for Oases transcriptome assembler by typing `/homes/sheltonj/abjc/oases_0.2.08/oases` or visit the Oases manual at https://www.ebi.ac.uk/~zerbino/oases/.\r\n\r\nTo find out more about the parameters for \"AssembleT.pl\" type `perl ~/transcriptome-and-genome-assembly/KSU_bioinfo_lab/AssembleT/AssembleT.pl -man` or visit its manual at https://github.com/i5K-KINBRE-script-share/transcriptome-and-genome-assembly/tree/master/KSU_bioinfo_lab/AssembleT/AssembleT_README.md.\r\n\r\n### RNA-Seq reference based differential expression\r\n*************************************************\r\n\r\n### Go to: \r\nhttps://github.com/i5K-KINBRE-script-share/RNA-Seq-annotation-and-comparison/blob/master/KSU_bioinfo_lab/RNA-SeqAlign2RefREADME.md\r\n\r\nThe script writes scripts and qsubs to generate count summaries for Illumina paired end reads after mapping against a reference genome. The script 1) converts illumina headers if the `-c` parameter is used, 2) cleans raw reads using Prinseq http://prinseq.sourceforge.net/manual.html, 3) indexes the reference genome for mapping, 4) reads are aligned to the genome with Tophat2 (read more about Tophat2 at http://tophat.cbcb.umd.edu/manual.html) and expressed genes and transcripts are assembled with Cufflinks2, 5) these assemblies are merged with Cuffmerge and differential expression is estimated with Cuffdiff2.\r\n \r\nTo begin you should read about the software we will be using. Prinseq will be used to clean raw reads. Priseq cleaning is highly customizable. You can see a detailed parameter list by typing `perl /homes/sheltonj/abjc/prinseq-lite-0.20.3/prinseq-lite.pl -h` or by visiting their manual at http://prinseq.sourceforge.net/manual.html. You can read a detailed list of parameter options for Tophat2 by typing `/homes/bjsco/bin/tophat2 -h` or visit the Tophat manual at http://tophat.cbcb.umd.edu/manual.html. Cufflink parameters are listed by running `/homes/bjsco/bin/cufflinks`. Cuffdiff2 parameters are listed by running `/homes/bjsco/bin/cuffdiff`. If you use the software for research you should read the article describing the Cuffdiff2 algorithm and performance http://bioinformaticsk-state.blogspot.com/2013/04/cuffdiff-2-and-isoform-abundance.html.\r\n\r\nYou will be using the script \"RNA-SeqAlign2Ref.pl\" to organize your working directory and write scripts to index your reference genome (hg19), clean out reads, map your cleaned reads using Tophat2,\r\n\r\nTo find out more about the parameters for \"RNA-SeqAlign2Ref.pl\" run `perl ~/RNA-Seq-annotation-and-comparison/KSU_bioinfo_lab/RNA-SeqAlign2Ref.pl -man` or visit its manual at https://github.com/i5K-KINBRE-script-share/RNA-Seq-annotation-and-comparison/tree/master/KSU_bioinfo_lab\r\n\r\n\r\nimage by Krzysztof Szkurlatowski; 12frames.eu\r\n","google":"UA-49227836-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
