All pipelines take you from raw data received from your sequencing facility to finished analysis using Beocat https://www.cis.ksu.edu/beocat (the largest compute cluster in Kansas which is free to all researchers in the K-INBRE network).\r\n\r\nNo experience with command line is necessary before using these scripts but a free Beocat account is. \r\n\r\nAll of the scripts you will need to complete use these pipelines as well as the sample dataset will be copied to your Beocat directory as you follow the instructions in the links below. You should type or paste the text in the beige code block into your terminal as you follow along with the instructions. If you are not used to commandline, practice with real data is one of the best ways to learn.\r\n\r\nIf you would like a quick primer on basic linux commands try these 10 minute lessons from Software Carpentry http://software-carpentry.org/v4/shell/index.html.

The script 1) converts illumina headers if the `-c` parameter is used, 2) cleans raw reads using Prinseq http://prinseq.sourceforge.net/manual.html, 3) indexes the reference genome for mapping, 4) reads are aligned to the genome with Tophat2 (read more about Tophat2 at http://tophat.cbcb.umd.edu/manual.html) and expressed genes and transcripts are assembled with Cufflinks2, 5) these assemblies are merged with Cuffmerge and differential expression is estimated with Cuffdiff2 (see http://bioinformaticsk-state.blogspot.com/2013/04/cuffdiff-2-and-isoform-abundance.html).\r\n \r\nimage by Krzysztof Szkurlatowski; 12frames.eu\r\n","google":"UA-49227836-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
