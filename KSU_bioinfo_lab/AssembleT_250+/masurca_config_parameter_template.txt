#this is k-mer size for deBruijn graph values between 25 and 101 are supported, auto will compute the optimal size based on the read data and GC content. Do not set this longer than PE read length!!!
GRAPH_KMER_SIZE=auto
#set this to 1 for Illumina-only assemblies and to 0 if you have 2x or more long (Sanger, 454) reads
USE_LINKING_MATES=1
#this parameter is useful if you have too many jumping library mates. Typically set it to 60 for bacteria and something large (300) for mammals
LIMIT_JUMP_COVERAGE = 60
#these are the additional parameters to Celera Assembler. do not worry about performance, number or processors or batch sizes -- these are computed automatically. for mammals do not set cgwErrorRate above 0.15!!!
